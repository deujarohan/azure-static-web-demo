# Azure Static Web Demo

## Project Overview

This is a simple **static website deployed using Azure Static Web Apps**.  
It displays my full name, student number, course code, and the text:  
`Azure Static Web Apps Deployment Successful`.

## How to View

- The website is live at: [https://black-river-03d9ae110.4.azurestaticapps.net]
- Every push to the repository automatically updates the site via GitHub Actions.

## Files

1. **index.html** – Main webpage with name, course code, confirmation text, and link to `style.css`.
2. **style.css** – Adds basic styling to the page.
3. **grading.json** – Contains student info and Azure URL required for grading.
4. **package.json** – Dummy file with a “build” script; added to satisfy Azure workflow (Oryx detects Node.js and expects a build step).

**.github/workflows/azure-static-web-apps.yml** – Auto-generated by Azure; handles deployment automatically.
